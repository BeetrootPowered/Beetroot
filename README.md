# BeetrootServer

Beetroot is a Minecraft server written from scratch using Kotlin aiming to be simple and lightweight.
The server runs on top of JVM and NodeJS, it doesn't implement a full Minecraft server intentionally for low memory and CPU usage, but its functionality can be extended through plugins.

The project is currently a WIP.
